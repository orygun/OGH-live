			<h4>PHP Web Developer / Database Management</h4>
			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>I have over 10 years experience in web design. I first got into the 
			field with the desire to learn how to build a better website for my 
			billiard supply company.</p>
			<p>My interest only grew from there, as I saw the 
			ever changing world of the web as we know it. I ended up building a site 
			with over 4,000 products managing products, articles, videos,
			new products every 3 months.
			</p> 
		<!--
			<p>Later, I became a Web Designer / Tech Support for Tannerite Sports LLC after recovering their site from a hack which diverted customer information to a supposed judicial website located in Russia.</p>
			<p>Since then, I have gone back to school and gotten deeper into eCommerce Design and customer interactivity, as the field never seems to stop growing and the number of business websites keeps growing. I love learning new things and this has been a great drive that never seems to end.</p>

			 camping and kayaking around the many rivers and lakes of Oregon has to offer.</p>
			<p>I also camp and kayak around the many rivers Oregon has to offer.</p>
